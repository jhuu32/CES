    "# MisSpelling Map Builder\n",
    "This notebook is aimed to fix upfront misspelled words from the training text. It proceeds along below priority order:\n",
    "* identify firstly all unknown/out of vocabulary words\n",
    "* among previously identified unknown term, try to suggest a fix based on the custom/medical named entity we built specifically\n",
    "  * drug name\n",
    "  * active ingredient\n",
    "* in a second time, try to suggest a fix based on the general thesaurus\n",
    "\n",
    "We favor first domain specific named entities because their spelling is pretty particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "It generates 3 csv files into staging_data folder, defining the map from the misspelled word to its fix suggestion:\n",
    "* mispelled_drug_names.csv\n",
    "* mispelled_ingredient_names.csv\n",
    "* mispelled_general_names.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain specific named entity correction is inspired from https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html souce code.\n",
    "It relies on the Levenshtein word distance principle and takes adavantge of the word frequency (learnt from large corpus) to compute the likehood of the word suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A threshold on the Levenshtein distance needs to be defined to accept the correction suggestion: I prefer to compute the ratio between Levenshtein disance over the word length as this indicator is more significant to identify unintentional spelling incorrectness.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the general purpose vocabulary, I make use of the **SpellChecker** package which comes with french resources."
