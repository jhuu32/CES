# Comparative Study to Solve Text Categorization
# CES Data Scientist 2017-2018

This github project hosts a rookie's experiment to resolve naively a complex text classification problem by comparing 2 approaches:
* Deep Learning (**D**L)technique which has regained tremendous attraction from the Machine Learning community to address NLP problem
* Traditional Technique which is basically based on non-DL principle

It's organized into below folders:
* **data** contains training/external source/staging data consumed or produced by the learning pipelines
* **notebooks** stores all Jupyter notebooks
* **pretrained_models** refers to models which are available publicly and are consumed "as is" in the experiment
* **reports** holds the reports summarizing the NLP experiment
* **temp** misc temporary artifacts
